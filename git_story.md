# The Development Story of Git-Narrate

## Introduction

Git-Narrate was conceived on August 6, 2025, with a clear mission: to transform raw git repository data into coherent, human-readable narratives. The project was born from the recognition that while git provides a comprehensive record of changes, this data is often technical and difficult to interpret without specialized knowledge. Git-Narrate aims to bridge this gap by analyzing git history and generating compelling stories about a project's development journey. From its inception, the project was designed as a command-line tool that could process any git repository and output documentation in multiple formats.

## Development Phases

The development of Git-Narrate began on its inception date when Sithum Sathsara made the first commit, establishing the project's foundation. The initial phase focused on implementing the core functionality, with the first significant feature being the addition of AI token capabilities. This early development set the stage for a modular architecture that would prove essential for the tool's flexibility and extensibility.

The project's architecture was thoughtfully designed with several key components working in harmony. The `analyzer.py` module serves as the heart of the tool, utilizing GitPython to read git repositories and extract commit data. The `narrator.py` module transforms this raw data into structured narratives, while the `ai_narrator.py` extends capabilities by integrating with the Z.ai API for more sophisticated story generation. For visual representation, the `visualizer.py` module employs matplotlib to create informative charts and
